# gluex_demon

## GlueX/Hall D detector monitoring scripts.

These scan GlueX/HallD monitoring histograms and make root graphs to show on [halldweb](https://halldweb.jlab.org/gluex_demon/demon.html?RunPeriod=RunPeriod-2022-05&Version=24)

### Directory structure

* make_new_module contains a template module and a script to test it, and more documentation.

* scan contains the operational modules and the script to run them, and more documentation.

* web contains the files for halldweb.

### Caveat
This is fledgling code, under development by Naomi Jarvis.
