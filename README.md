# gluex_demon

## GlueX/Hall D detector monitoring scripts.

These scan GlueX/HallD monitoring histograms and make root graphs to show on halldweb

###Directory structure

* make_new_module contains a template module and a script to test it.

* scan contains the operational modules and the script to run them.

* web will contain the files for halldweb.

###Caveat
This is fledgling code, under development by Naomi Jarvis, nsj@cmu.edu
